## Project for Database course PGBSNH24P

This project is mainly about using SQL with a Postgres database, learning about Docker and basic C#. Not using ORM is a deliberate choice.
There are many mistakes I've realized during my journey such as: 
- Not using HttpResponse/HttpRequest in controllers.
- Not always following naming conventions for Async methods.
I've not had the time to amend these issues at this time.
